The aim of the project is to create a model of the analog signal obtained at the output of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for a given sampling rate, DAC bit and the shape of the ideal signal. The model should provide construction of time dependences of ideal, discretized signals and quantization error. The model should also calculate the RMS value of quantization noise. Functional generators are usually used as sources of test signals. For example, it is necessary to check the response of a certain electronic device to the influence of an input signal with certain time or frequency characteristics. A practical example is to check the operation of the amplitude detector. In this case, the input of the amplitude detector is fed an AM signal with a known depth of modulation and evaluate the operation of the AM detector based on the obtained output signal.
